## Introduction
This repository is a collection of resources and examples related to DevOps practices, including but not limited to infrastructure as code (IaC), continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), monitoring, logging, and configuration management. It aims to provide a reference and starting point for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.

## Goals
- **Automate repetitive tasks:** Reduce manual intervention in infrastructure management and application deployment.
- **Ensure consistency:** Maintain consistent environments across different stages of development (dev, staging, production).
- **Improve collaboration:** Provide a common framework for developers and operations teams to work together.
- **Enhance security:** Implement best practices for security and secrets management.
- **Increase reliability:** Improve system reliability through monitoring, logging, and alerting.

## Key Components
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Scripts and configurations for provisioning and managing infrastructure using tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Examples and templates for setting up automated build, test, and deployment pipelines using Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD tools.
- **Configuration Management:** Playbooks and roles for automating system configuration using tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Configurations and scripts for setting up monitoring and logging solutions using Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, etc.
- **Secrets Management:** Best practices and examples for managing sensitive information securely using tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.
- **Containerization:** Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, and Helm charts for containerized application deployment.
